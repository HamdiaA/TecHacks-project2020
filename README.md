# TecHacks-project2020
Here is our TecHacks project! Made using Qoom. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also used a general template from w3schools, and edited from there according to our preferences.
The category prize we aim for are: 
1) Winnner for health track
2) Overall top three
3) Most creative hack
4) Beginner hack (all of us have less than a year's experience with web development)
5) Sponsored challenege by Qoom
