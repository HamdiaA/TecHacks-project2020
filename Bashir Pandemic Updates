					  	<strong>2020/21 School Year</strong><br><br>
					    The province of Ontario is currently in the middle of deciding what the next school year for k-12 will look like. The general idea is that schools will open in an adapted model, with attendance in-person non-mandatory. Parents have the ultimate decision of whether their child will attend in-person school or online school.

				  <h2>New Zealand</h2>
					<p>
					  	<strong>Champions of proper resonse to pandemic</strong><br><br>
					    New Zealand is now known for their coordinated response and prevention of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were successful in closing everything immediately, with strict rules and regulations for its citizens. Unlike other places, where people are going to beaches, or going to a park with 10000 people, New Zealanders were very cautious. Hence the decreased reported cases and the relieving lift on restrictions.
